# S2S-Connection-Btw-two-Vnets
S2S, or Site-to-Site, connection is a networking feature
provided by Microsoft Azure that enables secure
communication between an on-premises network and a virtual
network in Azure. It allows organizations to extend their onpremises infrastructure to the cloud and establish a secure and
private connection.
The S2S connection establishes a virtual network gateway in
Azure, which serves as a bridge between the on-premises
network and the virtual network. This gateway facilitates
encrypted communication and allows traffic to flow securely
between the two environments.
The key benefits of using S2S connection in Microsoft
Azure include:
Hybrid Connectivity: S2S connection enables the creation of a
hybrid network environment by securely connecting onpremises resources to Azure. This allows organizations to
leverage the benefits of the cloud while maintaining
connectivity to their existing infrastructure.
Secure Communication: S2S connection establishes an
encrypted tunnel over the public internet, ensuring that data
transmitted between the on-premises network and Azure
remains secure and protected from unauthorized access.
Scalability: With S2S connection, organizations can easily
scale their network infrastructure by extending it to Azure
without the need for significant hardware investments. This
flexibility allows for seamless integration of on-premises and
cloud resources.

Redundancy and High Availability: S2S connection supports
redundant connections, ensuring high availability and fault
tolerance. Organizations can configure multiple connections to
Azure for improved resiliency and failover capabilities.
Compatibility: S2S connection in Azure is compatible with
various network devices and VPN technologies, allowing
organizations to integrate their existing networking equipment
and leverage their preferred VPN solutions.
